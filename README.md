Wow just wow, I just walked out of The Monkey and my mind is still spinning like I’m on a never-ending carousel yeah. The popcorn was stale, by the way, and some got stuck in my teeth but that’s just my teeth, bad vibes tonight. Right from the opening scene, the colors HIT you like a cold splash of water. The monkey talking to ghosts?? What’s that even supposed to mean? I still don’t get the bananas in the aquarium bit lol, but my aching back says it must’ve been deep.

> That theater was noisy as ever, someone kept coughing behind me — no escaping those echoes — sounding like a broken radio or something, and it made me remember Uncle Charlie and his old beat-up taxi radio, always static, static, static.

– Oooh that scene where the monkey's flying through the city like superman? I think I almost spilled my drink but it’s okay because I was way too invested in wondering if it would crash. And then the music, kinda like someone remixed an elevator tune, kept my head buzzing, like those neon lights blinking outside my window late at night.

I have no clue what happened in Act 2, but there were clashing symbols and I’m sure there was a dancer twirling with an umbrella or was it a pizza? Don’t ask me about the narrative because maybe the ups and downs were just life, you know? Man, the way the forest scene melted into the spider web sequence, felt like my brain was trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   while stuck in buffering purgatory.

I walked out before the credits finished — just too much to process, like trying to understand why cats chase red dots, just alive but nonsensical. Yeah, but if you catch it on 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨, do that. Some people asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   so let them know it does things to your head that real life just doesn’t.

Anyway, so yeah, monkey all the way. Need to stretch this back a bit, feeling like creaky doors opening in a haunted house. Gonna sleep and dream of blue talking lizards now, I think.

Here's a random thoughtlet I found: function bananaChase(monkey, city) { if (banana === tasty) return false; } But who knows what that even means anymore...
